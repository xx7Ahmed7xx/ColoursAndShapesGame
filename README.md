--- Here goes nothing ---
The glorious and amazing game of Colours and Shapes made by me :)
This game is aimed for children to let them get familiar with the mouse and keyboard of a PC (or laptop etc..)
It is in arabic but simple : Has 4 levels from no time to extremely hard, you must put each shape on it's correct place.
The lower your end time, The better your scoreboard would be.

<<-- IMPORTANT -->>
ColoursAndShapes is owned by me, thus I don't allow anyone to use it in any manner or edit it, The work is compeletly mine and should be clear like that.
